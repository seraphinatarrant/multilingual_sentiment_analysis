# Fairness in Multilingual Sentiment Analysis
Pytorch and huggingface implementation of Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant's internship project 
"Fairness in Multilingual Sentiment Analysis".

## Structure
All python and bash scripts for running experiments are in the top-level directory:
`SubjectiveNLP-scratch/internships/sgt`.
Models and results, which are larger (some very large!) are on the efs volume: `/home/ec2-user/SageMaker/efs/sgt/` 
in the 4 directorires `models`, `compressed_models`, `baseline_models`, and `results`.

If you're just looking for the documents (pdfs and tex files of research proposal, midterm report, 
end of internship draft), they can be found under `internship_documents`.
